### Just a simple code to have some fun
# Story of Tetris #
The true story of Tetris isn't just about falling blocks; it's a Cold War-era thriller of genius, bureaucratic mazes, and a handshake deal that changed the world of gaming forever.

From Moscow to the World
The genesis of the game was humble. It was the summer of 1984 in Moscow, and Soviet computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov was working at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His official work was in artificial intelligence, but his passion was puzzles. Inspired by a childhood pentomino game—where various shapes made of five squares must fit into a box—he set out to create a digital version. But five-square pieces felt too complex for real-time play. He cut it down to four.

Pajitnov coded the game on an Electronika 60 terminal. He named it "Tetris," a mashup of "tetra" (the Greek prefix for four, as in the four squares making up each piece) and his favorite sport, tennis. The game was mesmerizing: seven unique geometric shapes, or "Tetriminos," dropping one by one, twisting and fitting to clear solid lines. It was immediately addictive. Within weeks, the game had spread through the Academy and across Moscow's small but dedicated computer community, copied freely on floppy disks. It was a viral hit before "viral" was a word.

The Cold War Rights Race
As Tetris crossed borders, passing from programmer to programmer through the nascent international computing network, its ownership became a tangled nightmare. The Soviet Union had no concept of intellectual property for a state-employed programmer, so the rights were held by a Soviet state-owned company called ELORG (Electronorgtechnica). By 1989, multiple Western companies were claiming and selling versions of the game, convinced they had the legitimate license.

Enter Henk Rogers, a charismatic and adventurous Dutch programmer living in Japan, who had secured the rights for a Japanese computer company. He saw the game's true potential—not on bulky PCs, but as the perfect killer app for Nintendo's new handheld console, the Game Boy.

Rogers knew the current distribution mess was unsustainable. In a daring move, he traveled to Moscow, navigating the chilling atmosphere of a rapidly changing but still-firmly-Soviet capital. He walked unannounced into the offices of ELORG, which was headed by the tough-as-nails Nikolai Belikov.

The Handshake that Won the Game
Rogers' mission was simple but audacious: secure the elusive handheld and console rights from the Soviet state. The negotiations were tense, carried out through translators, fueled by strong tea, and shrouded in the suspicion of the Cold War. Rogers was up against powerful, established competitors, but he had two key advantages: his honest enthusiasm for the game's quality and his clear vision for the Game Boy. He was the only one who showed up in person, looking the Soviet officials in the eye.

In a move that has become legendary, Rogers convinced Belikov that the original Tetris creator, Pajitnov, deserved to benefit, even though Soviet law dictated otherwise. Rogers won the day. He walked away with the crucial rights for Nintendo, and when the Game Boy launched, Tetris was its pack-in game.

The result was an explosion. Tetris became a global phenomenon, selling tens of millions of copies. It transcended the label of a "video game" and became a cultural icon.

Alexey Pajitnov eventually emigrated to the United States, but his collaboration with Rogers was far from over. In 1996, a year after the original rights reverted back to Pajitnov, he and Henk Rogers formally established The Tetris Company. This final act not only righted a historical wrong, ensuring the game’s creator finally benefited from his genius, but also solidified their lifelong friendship and partnership.

The tale of Tetris is a reminder that sometimes, the simplest and most elegant creations can take the most complicated routes to success, a testament to the power of a perfect design surviving the chaos of international bureaucracy.
